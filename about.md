# Yes hello there, welcome!

My name is Filip Gal, I'm a student at Linnaeus Univeristy in Kalmar, Sweden. This website is part of an assignment where I am to create a static site with Jekyll and customize it myself.

So I'm studying the Web Developer programme at above mentioned university, in this current course I have a few tasks, I'll mention a few of them below.

* Create several blog posts where I reflect on the beneficts of Static site generators and CSS preprocessors, compare said preproccessors to regular CSS, which techniques I used and what the pros and cons of CSS preproccessors are.

* My blog posts should allow for comments.

* I am to use open graph for easy social media integration.
