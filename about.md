# Yes hello there, welcome!

My name is Filip Gal, I'm a 20-something guy who likes doing stuff, like most people. Stuff I enjoy doing is mountain biking, strength training, cooking, listening to music, and drinking the occasional beer. Pretty average stuff!

I'm a student at Linnaeus Univeristy in Kalmar, Sweden. This website is part of an assignment where I am to create a static site with Jekyll and customize it myself.
