### Static site generators and what they're good for <!--more-->

Static site generators (henceforth referred to as SSGs) gives the user or developer a perfect starting point for a new project. Any good SSG will provide you with a basic boilerplate that contains enough componenets to be actually useful. Jekyll, which we use in this assignment, comes with a base theme that I altered to make it stand out a bit more, having to write all functionality and modularity that the SSG has provided me would mean that this wouldn't be a two week project, but probably a two **month** project.

For any smaller project where maintenance will be a rarity, using a SSG is a perfect opportunity. And most of the web is made up of these smaller projects.  

Everything isn't perfect though. The initial setup time is rather substantial, at least in my case, figuring out how everything is connected and what template code to change and not to change has taken some time.

Overall, I really liked using Jekyll, as mentioned above, the inital startup was a bit confusing, but once you get into it and see the big picture, everything becomes clear. For the most part, using an SSG is a very effective way of jump starting a new project.

Who knows what this will look like in the future? Probably no one, I for one think Static Sites are the way to go and the way they will develop will only be beneficial for developers, reducing time in the initial build, and instead using boilerplates and build on these.
