### What humans.txt and robots.txt is and how I used them. <!--more-->

**robots.txt**

robots.txt is just a text file where you can set different parameters, or instructions if you will, which tells web crawlers if they are allowed to access a certain file or folder on your website.

**humans.txt**

The humans.txt contains information about the origin of the website, the team or person behind it, special thanks, and what different programs and software was used in the making of the website.
How I used it is pretty straight forward, I included my name, and my github account, and mentioned what standards, programs, and softwares that was used.
